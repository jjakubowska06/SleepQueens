# SleepQueens - Custom Alarm Technology (CAT App)
This repository contains a prototype for a personalized alarm clock system, focused on the variability of sleep cycles in each individual.

** Fig 1. **Simulation of an online generation of hypnogram, along with accessing sleep cycles. The signal ('sleep-telemetry/ST7112J0-PSG.edf') used for the simulation comes from the SleepEDF Database Expanded [2] from Physionet [3].

## Authors

## Methodology
Core of the software is based on the AI-based automatic sleep staging tool Yasa [1]. Based on this software, an online hypnogram generation would take place, along with accessing sleep cycles.
