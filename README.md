# SleepQueens - Custom Alarm Technology (CAT App)
This repository contains a prototype for a personalized alarm clock system, focused on the variability of sleep cycles in each individual.

## Methodology
The core of the software is based on the AI-based automatic sleep staging tool Yasa [3]. Based on this software, an online hypnogram generation would take place, along with accessing sleep cycles.
